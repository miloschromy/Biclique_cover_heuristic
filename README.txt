You need g++ 5.0 and higher
Use make  on Makefile

>make                          # compile all and run all tests
>make run_tests                # same as >make
>make matching_tests           # compile tests of CNF formulae
>make biclique_cover_tests     # compile tests for Biclique SAT formulae
>make run_matching_tests       # compile and run tests of CNF formulae
>make run_biclique_cover_tests # compile and run tests for Biclique SAT formulae
>make clear                    # clean all nasty files. And normal. Just clean all files made by make
